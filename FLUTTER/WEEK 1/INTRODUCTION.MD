## WEEK 1

### WHAT IS FLUTTER?

Flutter is a mobile User Interface framework for creating [native apps](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/native-application-native-app#:~:text=A%20native%20application%20is%20a%20software%20program%20that,the%20ability%20to%20use%20device-specific%20hardware%20and%20software.) for IOS and Android. It uses single code-base i.e we will have to write the code for the application only once and the same can run in both the predominant mobile operating systems. The applications created get access to the platform APIs like camera, microphone, etc.

* The single code-base is created using programming language *Dart*.

* Gives a smooth and quick experience when running apps.
