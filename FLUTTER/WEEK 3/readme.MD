### WIDGETS

#### TEXT WIDGET

The Text widget allows you to create a styled text in your application.

#### CONTAINER WIDGET

The Container widget allows to create a rectangular visual element. A container has properties, such as a background, a border, or a shadow. A Container can also have margins, padding, and constraints applied to its size.

#### APPBAR WIDGET

The AppBar widget creates a Container with a height of 56 device-independent pixels with an internal padding of 8 pixels, both on the left and the right. Inside the container, AppBar uses a Row layout to organize its children. The middle child, the title widget, is marked as Expanded, which means it expands to fill any remaining available space that hasnâ€™t been consumed by the other children. You can have multiple Expanded children and determine the ratio in which they consume the available space.

#### SCAFFOLD WIDGET

The Scaffold widget organizes its children in a vertical column. At the top of the column it places an instance of AppBar, passing the app bar a Text widget to use as its title. Passing widgets as arguments to other widgets is a powerful technique that lets you create generic widgets that can be reused in a wide variety of ways. Finally, Scaffold uses an Expanded to fill the remaining space with its body, which consists of a centered message.
